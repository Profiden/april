Run the example using the command: 
```
cargo run.
```

Make sure to add the necessary dependencies to your Cargo.toml file:
```
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
```

This example uses the serde and serde_json crates for JSON serialization and deserialization.
