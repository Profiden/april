## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/951417646191083551/1193927724616654909/image.png?ex=65ae7ed7&is=659c09d7&hm=5fd754a6776bb2998fd877218a1993f8aec01fa8de6a57cee7b3b4bb4e41858e&)

This language was made for making API's great ease and more efficiency. 

The language connects each API endpoint to a specific program/command, in case you want to write the code for the endpoint '/home' in python and '/generate' in Cpp - this can be done.

The language have packages for multiple languages for adapting april to the wanted language (some packages are made by the community too!!) . In case you dont find the required package for utilizing april in your wanted language - don't worry its easy to make a package for your own.

## Built With

- Written in python3
- Makes use of FASTAPI

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- Python3
- Pip3
- Redis server

### Installation

WIndows :
```sh
pip install aprillang
```

Linux / MacOs:
```sh
pip3 install aprillang
```

## Usage

Get the list of allowed commands
```sh
april -h
```

Get info of the language
```sh
april -a
```

Compile an .apl file (april file):
- This converts the april code to python3 code
- Compiled file is saved as filename without extention apl + '_apl.py'

```sh
april -c file.apl
```

Run an .apl file (start the API server):
- Format for the command is - april -r <filename> <host:port>

```sh
april -r file.apl 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Get the version of april:

```sh
april -v
```
